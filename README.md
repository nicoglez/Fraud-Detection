# Fraud-Detection


This Python project aims to develop a fraud classification system using logistic regression technique. Fraud represents a significant threat in various sectors, such as financial transactions, e-commerce, and insurance, among others.


Through exploratory data analysis and the implementation of logistic regression in Python, the project aims to identify patterns and distinctive features of fraud cases in the given database to effectively detect and prevent future instances. The project aims to provide a reliable and effective tool to mitigate the risks associated with fraud, thereby protecting resources and enhancing overall transaction security in the provided database.
